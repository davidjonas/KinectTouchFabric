# KinectTouchFabric
An OpenFrameworks app that uses a kinect (or multiple) to detect touches on a fabric. This is part of the [Sensory Deprivation](https://github.com/davidjonas/SensoryDeprivation) installation.
This uses my opensource addon [ofxKinectTracker](https://github.com/davidjonas/ofxKinectTracker).
